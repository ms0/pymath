Python code for mathematical classes

Classes to implement finite fields (ffield.py), rationals (rational.py),
quaternions (quaternion.py), and matrices (matrix.py) over any ring.

A test program for ffield.py (test_ffield.py) is included; it uses matrix.py

A demonstration of secret sharing using finite fields is also included (share.py),
together with an html-based slide presentation (secretsharing.html)
